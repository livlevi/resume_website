Resume website, hosted on AWS connected to DynamoDB via API Gateway &amp; Lambda

Welcome to my attempt at completing the Cloud Resume Challenge AWS ( also including projects from cloudisfree.com ). I have had some experience with AWS, however I never feel like I know enough ... about anything actually. I decided to take this challenge and tweak the challenge in some ways. It's been a lot of fun so far.
